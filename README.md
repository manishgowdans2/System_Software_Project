# Linker_Implementation
Created a C program for pass1 linking loader and pass2 linking loader


In computing, a linker also called as link editor is a computer system program that takes one or more object files
which is generated by the compiler or assembler and combines them into a single executable file. 
The linker also takes care of arranging the objects in a programâ€™s address space.

The general aim of this project is to simulate the working of a linker. As it is an important component in the stages of execution,
its working and fundamental concepts will be highlighted and implemented through this project.

Linking is performed at both compile time, when source code is translated to machine code and load time, when the program is loaded into memory by loader.
  
Source Code->Compiler->Assembler->Object code->Linker->Executable File->Loader

In first pass External Symbol Table(ESTAB) is generated. This can also be accessible later by pass 2.
It is used to store the name and address of each External Symbols in a set of Control Sections and also
it assigns address to all External Symbols. It has two variables PROGADDR and CSADDR.
PROGADDR is the beginning address in memory where the linked program is to be loaded, 
and CSADDR contains the starting address assigned to the control section currently being scanned by the loader.
               
               
Pass 2 linking loader performs actual loading, relocation, and linking. It uses modification record and lookup

First, the code defines the necessary structures (exttable and objectcode) and includes the required header files.

The main() function is the entry point of the program. It starts by declaring variables and file pointers.

It then opens three files: "Executable_Code.dat" for reading the input, "ESTAB.dat" for reading the external symbol table, and "OUTPUT.txt" for writing the output.

The code reads the external symbol table from "ESTAB.txt" into the estab array. It stores the control section address, external symbol, and their corresponding addresses and lengths.

It sets the exeloc variable to the address of the first control section. loc and start are set to the same value initially.

The code begins reading the input file "INPUT.txt". It processes the input line by line.

When it encounters an 'H' record, it reads the program name and finds its corresponding starting address (pstart) from the external symbol table.

It then proceeds to process 'T', 'M', and other records.

For 'T' records, it reads the starting address (textloc) and length (textlen) of the object code. It calculates the absolute address (loc) by adding textloc to pstart.

It reads the object code instructions and stores them in the obcode array, along with their respective addresses (add).

For 'M' records, it reads the modification record details and stores the modification location (mloc), length (mlen), and label in separate arrays.

For other records (instructions), it reads the instructions and stores them in the obcode array.

After processing all the records, the code proceeds to the second pass.

In the second pass, it applies the modifications to the object code based on the modification records. It calculates the new addresses based on the external symbol table and updates the obcode array.

Finally, it writes the updated object code to the output file "OUTPUT.txt" in the desired format.

The code then closes all the file pointers.

It prints the contents of the output file on the console, which shows the object code in the desired format.

the symbol in ESTAB to obtain its address. Finally it uses end record of a main program to obtain transfer address,
which is a starting address needed for the execution of the program. The pass 2 process Text record and Modification record of the object programs.
